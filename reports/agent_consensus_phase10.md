# 🤖 Agent Consensus Report (Phase 10)

## Summary
All agents have completed their deep-dive analysis. 
Detailed thought processes are available in individual files:
- [Agent_1_Routing_Logic](Agent_1_Routing_Logic.md)
- [Agent_2_Excel_Dynamic](Agent_2_Excel_Dynamic.md)
- [Agent_3_UI_Interaction](Agent_3_UI_Interaction.md)

## aggregated Findings
1. **Routing**: Parity mismatch in graph generation (Undirected vs Directed assumptions).
2. **Excel**: Hardcoded schema causing data loss.
3. **UI**: Event propagation and modifier key logic flaws blocking single selection.

## Final Decision
All fixes have been applied via One-Shot Execution.
