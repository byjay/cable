I attempted to access the project root to search for error evidence and categorize failure causes, but failed because I cannot access local file paths. I halted the review process as I lack the necessary permissions to read the specific error reports and configuration files directly.
Please provide the content of ERROR_REPORT.md, logs, and any configuration files (.env, .json, etc.) so I can complete the analysis and propose actionable fixes.
