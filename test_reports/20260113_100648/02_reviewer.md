I attempted to scan the directory for error evidence and configuration files, but I cannot directly access the local file system at `F:\genmini\japness\JAP_BONG_fam` to read the specific contents of `ERROR_REPORT.md`, `.env`, or configuration files.

Since I cannot inspect the files directly to identify the specific error, please run the following command to list the directory contents and display the content of the error report so I can proceed with the diagnosis:

`dir /b & type ERROR_REPORT.md`
