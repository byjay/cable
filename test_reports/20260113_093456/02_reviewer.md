I analyzed the project structure and error logs to identify potential failure points, though I was unable to directly access local file contents due to tool limitations. I structured a diagnostic plan focusing on verifying environment variables, Windows path handling, and build configuration integrity as critical checkpoints.

Please run the following command and paste the console output:
`dir /s /b ERROR_REPORT.md .env *.json *.log`
