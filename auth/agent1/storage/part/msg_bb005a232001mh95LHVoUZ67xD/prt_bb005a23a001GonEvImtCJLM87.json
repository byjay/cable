  "text": "I need to analyze the SDMS project structure to understand how users and projects are managed and whether data automatically updates when new users/projects are added. Please:\n\n1. First, explore the directory structure to understand the project layout\n2. Look for files related to user management and project management\n3. Search for database schemas, models, or data structures\n4. Find any update mechanisms, triggers, or auto-refresh functionality\n5. Look for API endpoints or services that handle user/project creation\n6. Check for any real-time update mechanisms or event listeners\n\nFocus on finding evidence of automatic data updates when users or projects are added. Look for patterns like:\n- Database triggers\n- Event listeners/emitters\n- Automatic UI refresh mechanisms\n- Real-time data synchronization\n- Background jobs or schedulers\n- WebSocket connections\n- Observer patterns\n\nProvide a comprehensive analysis of what you find regarding automatic data updates."
