This is a backend/logic focused analysis covering:\n\n1. **Project Structure Analysis**:\n   - Map out the overall directory structure and organization\n   - Identify the main technology stack and frameworks used\n   - Understand the project's purpose and architecture\n\n2. **Code Quality Assessment**:\n   - Analyze coding patterns, conventions, and best practices\n   - Identify code smells, anti-patterns, and technical debt\n   - Review error handling, logging, and testing coverage\n   - Assess code maintainability and readability\n\n3. **Security Analysis**:\n   - Identify potential security vulnerabilities\n   - Review authentication and authorization mechanisms\n   - Check for input validation and sanitization\n   - Analyze data protection and encryption practices\n   - Look for hardcoded secrets or credentials\n\n4. **Architecture Review**:\n   - Evaluate the overall system architecture and design patterns\n   - Assess separation of concerns and modularity\n   - Review data flow and component interactions\n   - Identify scalability and performance bottlenecks\n\n5. **Backend/Logic Focus**:\n   - Deep dive into API endpoints, business logic, and data processing\n   - Review database design and data access patterns\n   - Analyze service layer architecture and business rules\n   - Check for proper transaction management and data consistency\n\nPlease provide a detailed report with specific findings, code examples where relevant, and actionable improvement recommendations. Focus on practical insights that can help improve the project's quality, security, and maintainability.\n\nThe analysis should be thorough but concise, highlighting the most critical issues first. Use the /target path as the root directory for all analysis.",
